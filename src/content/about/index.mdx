title: "About Our Company"
description: |
  Tokai was founded by **Austin Hua** in **2022** and has gone through several phases of **exploration**, **release**, and **redefinition**. Over time, it became clear that the most compelling direction was also the most novel: integrating **real-time glucose data** with **language model conversations**.

  The **Tokai App** is our current focus—a tool that brings **physiological context** into the world of **AI interaction**. By layering glucose monitoring into **LLM-based dialogue**, Tokai opens up new possibilities in **self-awareness**, **emotional regulation**, and **intelligent health reflection**. It’s not about replacing doctors or coaches, but about enabling more grounded, **body-aware conversations**.

  Our company is registered in **Virginia** and plans to operate in **Taiwan**, where the intersection of **healthcare** and **innovation** creates fertile ground for what’s next.

  Tokai isn’t just about **AI**, or **health**—it’s about building a deeper interface between the **mind** and the **body**.
